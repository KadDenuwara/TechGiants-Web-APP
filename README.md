### Responsiveness

The responsiveness of the design was manually checked using the Chrome Developer Tools for various screens.

This included:

- iPhone SE
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy S8, S20 Ultra
- iPad Air and Mini
- Galaxy Fold
- Nest Hub and Hub Max
  
I also opted to use the responsiveness option and checked the screens at the following width sizes:

- 350px
- 768px
- 992px
- 1400px

No issues arose, due to the simple layout of the site.

## 9. Bugs

- While adding placeholders to the pages, I faced an issue where the post didn't show the Cloudinary link placeholder when no image was provided by the user. This happened because the model's placeholder didn't match properly. I fixed it by directly linking the placeholder in the HTML.

- There was an issue with the JavaScript redirecting the user to a post detail page after a successful upload. The script expected a JSON response but didn't receive it. I added a check to see what it was receiving, which then allowed it to redirect correctly.

- I had trouble selecting parts of a form generated by Django in the template because there was no HTML to work with. I used the developer tools to see the structure and fixed the issue of the form overflowing on the page.

- The slugs for post details were based on the post titles. During manual testing, I found that errors occurred when creating or editing a post with the same title as another. I solved this by generating a random slug for each post, allowing titles to be the same without causing issues.

## 10. Deployment

### Create Application

- If you don't have a Heroku account, start by signing up and logging in.
- To establish a new application, click the "new" button located at the top right corner of the dashboard, then select "Create new app."
- Pick a distinct name for the application, indicate your residing region, and proceed by clicking "Create App."

### Final Repo Preparations

- Execute necessary project migrations by entering python3 manage.py makemigrations followed by python3 manage.py migrate in the terminal.
- Integrate a Procfile into the project, including the line web: gunicorn [project_name].wsgi:application.
